These are (new) lecture notes for COMP2012: Languages and Computation. We are still referring to the [old notes ](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/11836742/mod_resource/content/3/g52lac-notes.pdf) for explanation and examples.

The new notes are using Lean notation and are accompanied by a (partial) formalisation. In the exercieses and in the exam we will be using Lean notation and refer to the definitions in these lecture notes.

The notes are going to be expanded and revised during the semester.
